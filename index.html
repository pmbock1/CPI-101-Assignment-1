			My name is Payton Bock and I am a second year Biochemistry student at ASU! I am interested in informatics mainly for the interdisciplinary field of bioinformatics and hope to earn an informatics minor. I have limited experience in programming in general and hope this course will set me on the right path to be a more well-rounded employee for my post college life.
